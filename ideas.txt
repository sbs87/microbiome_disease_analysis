Ideas:
-Machine learning algorithm that assigns/classifies potential disease states given a composition profile
-Same idea, but that assigns therapies 
-Analysis/algorithm that identifies candidate problematic species 
-Model that incorporates non bacterial factors such as body type measurements or lifestyles to incorporate into model
